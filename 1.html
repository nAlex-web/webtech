	<tr><td> Revenge is a terrific motivating force for young creative people and it certainly kept me going right through to the publication of my first novel. I'd been late to learn to read, and as a result the nuns at my school in Tennessee had me marked down as being somewhere between slow and stupid. They taught me for 12 years and even after I'd <div class = b1>caught up</div> and got smarter,
I was still thought of as dumb. 'They'll be sorry when they discover I'm a great writer,' I'd say to myself. 'In retirement, the single thing theyll be most proud of will be that they had me as a
pupil' And so it continued right through into the workplace where, in my first teaching job after leaving graduate school, the male head of the department would come to me whenever the secretarial staff were off. 'Type this up for me, will you, Ann?' he'd say habitually. 'One day,' I would think, <div class = b1>gritting my teeth</div>, 'One day...'

	<td> There must have been something unique or, at least, different about me as a boy, because I recall it would sometimes amuse my brother and his friends to throw beer cans at me. Why? Because of the clothes
I wore, which they didn't like, or because I wouldn't do whatever it was that they wanted me to, or just because it was fun.
But being different is fine. It was my father who encouraged in me the notion that I and I alone am responsible for my own life, for what I do and don't do, for my opinions and beliefs, and it's proved to be a great source of strength. I'm often asked if I read and take notice of critics. Which ones? Those who love the work? Who hate it? Or are indifferent? As a director, as in life, you have to <div class = b1>know your own mind</div> and be prepared to <div class = b1>stick to your guns</div>.

	<td> One of my tutors at Southport Catering College knew Anton Edelmann, the chef at the Savoy, and recommended me to him. I was very nervous of leaving <div class = b1>my comfort zone</div> and coming to London. I was a loner who'd never made friends because I was always working, and I was happy enough being alone and busy.
But I did come to London, and even though it was a very tough environment, I worked like a trouper and was very quick to learn. The hardest part was being away from my family and having to deal with other people while having no management or interpersonal skills whatsoever. So I called my dad every day, to <div class = b1>fill him in on</div> the good and bad, and ask him how he would deal with this or that.
